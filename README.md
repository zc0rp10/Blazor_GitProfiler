# Blazor Git Profiler
Small project to try out building an app with Blazor WebAssembly and the GitHub API. A nicer look at your GitHub Profile! With charts!

## Project Description
I've just started to learn a C# and wanted to see if I could scrap together a small web application out of it. It works well enough for what it is, one of those first projects where' you're happy that it works!

I did learn heaps about developing in Blazor and the dotnet CLI in the process as well as being exposed to some exposed to two very poplular libraries for .Net development.

## Built With
* [Blazor WebAssembly](/https://blazor.net/)
* [Newtonsoft Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
* [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [ChartsJS.Blazor](https://github.com/mariusmuntean/ChartJs.Blazor)
